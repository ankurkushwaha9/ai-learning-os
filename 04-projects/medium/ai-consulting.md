## 🎯 Overview
### Problem Statement
Organizations struggle to manage AI tool access across departments. Teams request different AI tools, usage is hard to track, and there's no centralized approval process.
### Solution
Built an internal AI Request Desk platform that centralizes AI resource management - allowing teams to submit requests, track usage, and manage approvals in one place.
