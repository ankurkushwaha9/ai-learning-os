## 🚀 What Are MCPs?
MCPs (Model Context Protocol) are integrations that allow Claude Desktop to connect with external tools and services. Instead of just chatting, Claude can:
- **Take actions** (create repos, make calls)
- **Access data** (read files, get transcripts)
- **Automate workflows** (push code, manage projects)
