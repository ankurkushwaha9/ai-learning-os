## 🎯 Why This Matters

Understanding how AI works (even at a high level) helps you:
- Write better prompts
- Understand limitations
- Debug unexpected outputs
- Choose the right tool for the job

## 🔑 Key Things to Know

1. **LLMs predict the next token** - They're sophisticated pattern matchers
2. **Context windows are limited** - There's a max input size
3. **Training data has a cutoff** - Models don't know recent events
4. **Temperature affects randomness** - Higher = more creative, lower = more focused
5. **Models can hallucinate** - They can confidently state false information
