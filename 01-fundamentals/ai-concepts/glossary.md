> Key terms every AI builder should know

---

## A-C

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A way to interact with AI models programmatically.

**Context Window**
The maximum amount of text (tokens) a model can process at once.

**Chain-of-Thought**
A prompting technique that asks the model to reason step-by-step.

---

## D-F

**Embedding**
A numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning.

**Fine-tuning**
Additional training on specific data to customize a model.

**Few-shot Learning**
Providing examples in the prompt to guide the model's output.

---

## G-L

**Hallucination**
When an AI generates false or nonsensical information confidently.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate language.

---

## M-P

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
A protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources.

**Prompt**
The input text given to an AI model.

**Parameters**
Settings that control model behavior (temperature, max tokens, etc.).

---

## R-T

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
Combining search/retrieval with generation for more accurate outputs.

**Temperature**
Controls randomness: 0 = deterministic, 1+ = more creative/random.

**Token**
The basic unit of text processing (roughly 4 characters or 3/4 of a word).

**Transformer**
The neural network architecture behind modern LLMs.

---

## Z

**Zero-shot**
Asking a model to perform a task without providing examples.
