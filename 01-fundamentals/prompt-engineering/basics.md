# Prompt Engineering Basics

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to get the best possible outputs from AI language models.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity
Be explicit about what you want. Ambiguity leads to unpredictable results.

**❌ Vague:** "Write something about dogs"

**✅ Clear:** "Write a 200-word informative paragraph about the health benefits of owning a dog, targeting first-time pet owners"

### 2. Context
Provide relevant background information.

**❌ No context:** "Fix this code"

**✅ With context:** "I'm building a Python Flask API. This function should return user data but throws a 500 error. Here's the code: [code]"

### 3. Structure
Organize complex prompts logically.

```
[Role/Context]
[Task Description]
[Specific Requirements]
[Output Format]
[Examples if needed]
```

### 4. Constraints
Set boundaries for better outputs.

- Word/character limits
- Format requirements
- Tone specifications
- What to include/exclude
